Factorial Calculator using Recursion - Motivation
The motivation behind creating this Factorial Calculator using recursion stems from the desire to explore and understand the concept of recursion in programming. Recursion is a powerful and elegant technique that allows a method to call itself to solve a problem. It provides an alternative approach to solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems.
This C# console application calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.

How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine:
Open the solution in your C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).

Build the solution to resolve dependencies.

Run the program.

Enter the number for which you want to find the factorial.

The program will use recursion to calculate the factorial and display the result.

How Recursion Works
Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve a problem. In this application, the Factorial method is implemented using recursion to calculate the factorial of a number.

Example
Suppose you enter the number 5. The application will calculate the factorial as follows:
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

The Factorial of the number 5 is 120
